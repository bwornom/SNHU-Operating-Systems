The Gaming Room is an online game hub that features interactive multiplayer games for users on various platforms. For this particular project, The Gaming Room requested
a game called 'Draw It or Lose It'. The game is an in-browser, live multiplayer game-show esque game. By creating a software design document, I was able to keep up with
client requests and have ongoing feedback and clarification throughout the development process. 
I was able to analyze requirements and present solutions before putting in the heavy development work very well. 
I found it helpful to 
If I had to revise one part of my work on these documents, I would have revised the UML Diagram to include more detail for storage structure. I would use what I learned
about serverless architecture to provide a visual for both the clients knowledge and our developers reference when ensuring security measures. 
It took some time to interpret the users needs for this project. Some of the requirements were broad, so I had to do research on the web to find the best results I could
that informed the meeting of specifications. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing to ensure the right work is going to be done before going to
all the hard work and spending resources to provide a solution. If mistakes are made, its better to make them in the design stage when they can be corrected.
When designing the software, I used techniques I learned about design patterns and security to produce the most secure, accurate code. In the future, I will take this 
knowledge with me to better plan and execute software development projects.
